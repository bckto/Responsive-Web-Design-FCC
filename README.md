# Responsive web design certificate - FreeCodeCamp
When I first started learning about programming I used a lot of the tutorials provided by FreeCodeCamp. 
As a "just for fun" project I decided to finish the certificate requirements for their Responsive Web Design course.

The certification process consisted on building pages using only HTML and CSS. However I decided to use both SASS and LESS compilers to practice with them as well. 

For this assigment I was asked to build 5 different pages: 

## 1 - Tribute page 
Check the [live version](https://codepen.io/CreativeBee/full/gOpggNx).  
## 2 - Survey form 
Check the [live version](https://codepen.io/CreativeBee/full/rNOxOPP).  
## 3 - Product Landing page 
Check the [live version](https://codepen.io/CreativeBee/full/ExZEKmj).  
## 4 - Documentation page
Check the [live version](https://codepen.io/CreativeBee/full/eYgbZWz).  
## 5 - Portfolio 
Check the [live version](https://codepen.io/CreativeBee/full/ZEezQLY).  

You can check each one of the pages separately or just open the portfolio one where you can find all of the links above.  
If you want to read more about the user story used to build each one of the pages, feel free to navigate to the readme files in the folders.
