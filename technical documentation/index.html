                JavaScript ("JS" for short) is a full-fledged dynamic programming language that can add interactivity to a website. It was invented by Brendan Eich (co-founder of the Mozilla project, the Mozilla Foundation, and the Mozilla Corporation).

            <p>
                JavaScript is versatile and beginner-friendly. With more experience, you'll be able to create games, animated 2D and 3D graphics, comprehensive database-driven apps, and much more!

            <h2>What tools professionals use?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    A computer. Maybe that sounds obvious to some people, but some of you are reading this article on your phone or a library computer. For serious web development, it's better to invest in a desktop or laptop computer running Windows, macOS or Linux.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A text editor, to write code in. This could be a text editor (e.g. Visual Studio Code, Notepad++, Sublime Text, Atom, GNU Emacs, or VIM), or a hybrid editor (e.g. Dreamweaver or WebStorm). Office document editors are not suitable for this use, as they
                    rely on hidden elements that interfere with the rendering engines used by web browsers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Web browsers, to test code in. Currently, the most-used browsers are Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Safari, Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge. You should also test how your site performs on mobile devices and on any old browsers your target audience may still
                    be using (such as IE 8â€“10). Lynx, a text-based terminal web browser, is great for seeing how your site is experienced by visually-impaired users.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A graphics editor, like GIMP, Figma, Paint.NET, Photoshop, Sketch or XD, to make images or graphics for your web pages.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A version control system, to manage files on servers, collaborate on a project with a team, share code and assets and avoid editing conflicts. Right now, Git is the most popular version control system along with the GitHub or GitLab hosting service.
                </li>
                <li>
                    An FTP program, used on older web hosting accounts to manage files on servers (Git is increasingly replacing FTP for this purpose). There are loads of (S)FTP programs available including Cyberduck, Fetch and FileZilla.
                </li>
                <li>
                    An automation system, like Webpack, Grunt, or Gulp to automatically perform repetitive tasks, such as minifying code and running tests.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Libraries, frameworks, etc., to speed up writing common functionality. A library tends to be an existing JavaScript or CSS file that provides ready-rolled functionality for you to make use of in your code. A framework tend to take this idea further, offering
                    a complete system with some custom syntaxes for you to write a web app on top of.

            <h1>Language basics</h1>
            <p>
                To give you a better understanding of how JavaScript works, let's explain some of the core features of the language. It's worth noting that these features are common to all programming languages. If you master these fundamentals, you have a head start
                on coding in other languages too!
            </p>
            <h2>Variables</h2>
            <p>
                Variables Variables are containers that store values. You start by declaring a variable with the var (less recommended, dive deeper for the explanation) or the let keyword, followed by the name you give to the variable:
            </p>
            <p><code>let myVariable;</code></p>
            <p>After declaring a variable, you can give it a value:</p>

            <code>myVariable = 'Bob';</code>
            <p>Also, you can do both these operations on the same line:</p>

            <code>let myVariable = 'Bob';</code>
            <p>You retrieve the value by calling the variable name:</p>

            <code>myVariable;</code>
            <p>
                After assigning a value to a variable, you can change it later in the code:
            </p>

            <code>let myVariable = 'Bob';</code>
            <code>myVariable = 'Steve';</code>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Data_types">
            <h1>Data types</h1>
            <p>
                String: This is a sequence of text known as a string. To signify that the value is a string, enclose it in single quote marks.
            </p>
            <code>let myVariable = 'Bob';</code>
            <p>Number:This is a number. Numbers don't have quotes around them.</p>
            <code>let myVariable = 10;</code>
            <p>
                Boolean:This is a True/False value. The words true and false are special keywords that don't need quote marks.
            </p>
            <code>let myVariable = true;</code>
            <p>
                Array:This is a structure that allows you to store multiple values in a single reference.
            </p>
            <code>let myVariable = [1,'Bob','Steve',10];
                Refer to each member of the array like this:
                myVariable[0], myVariable[1], etc.</code>
            <p>
                This can be anything. Everything in JavaScript is an object and can be stored in a variable. Keep this in mind as you learn.
            </p>
            <code>let myVariable = document.querySelector('h1');
                All of the above examples too.</code>
